# br_form
 A Development Assessment for BR to create a  data driven form

A goal is to create a data driven form, that will create components based on
provided information.
Create 5 fields that can be called up by their name as fieldType value.
New fields can be created in formComponents direcotory and will be automatically registered
to FormBuilder Component.
Component can be reused and using new data updated. Need to import new infomation. (For presentation purposes imported a json file
directly.

Successes: {

 *Created real time custom validators for each field.
 
 *Auto registration of child components
 
 *Good Design

Failures: {

 *Focused too much time on validation and ran out of time to get Vuex properly to work (plus lack of exposure to it)
 
 *Data submited gets saved to local machine
 
 *No results page
